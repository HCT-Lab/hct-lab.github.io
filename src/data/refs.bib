abstract = {Computer modeling and simulation of the human body is rapidly becoming a critical and central tool in a broad range of disciplines, including engineering, education, entertainment, physiology and medicine. Often, these models underpin the goal of transitioning from an artisanal practice to designing and making to an industrial engineering process. One reason for this approach is that designed and simulated models can be thoroughly tested and manufactured by machine to high tolerances, potentially removing much of the guess work when addressing complex human body dynamics and variations. The challenge for researchers is how to create patient-specific models with enough fidelity for in-silico simulation to accurately predict treatment outcomes. To address these challenges, we are developing technology to create dynamic, parametric, multiscale models of human musculoskeletal anatomy that can later be extended to include organ structures and other subsystems. We are working to provide a range, from low-to-high accuracy, of models, including high-resolution bone surfaces and detailed representations of muscle fibre structure and pennation. A significant component of our approach provides 3D finite element (FEM) muscle models coupled with multibody simulation techniques including contact handling and constraints. Our primary modelling effort is for the oral, pharyngeal and laryngeal (OPAL) complex to predict functional outcomes, such as chewing, swallowing and speaking. I report on our progress with our interdisciplinary team of scientific and clinical investigators, and collaborators and iRSM partners, the advances we have made including: an advanced Functional Reference ANatomy Knowledge (FRANK) template of the head and neck that can be registered structurally and functionally to patient-specific data, new techniques for patient-specific registration, liquid bolus simulations in the head and neck models, and a new technique for simulating speech from the biomechanics of the airway. Based on our experiences, I will outline a number of grand challenges that require a community of clinical, scientific and engineering researchers to address before we can transition to patient treatment as an engineered solution.},

The main factor common to the design of most collaborative interfaces for novices is that musical control is highly restricted, which makes it possible to learn easily and participate in the collective experience. Balancing this trade-off is a key concern for designers, as this happens at the expense of providing an upward path to virtuosity with the interface. We attempt to identify design considerations exemplified by a sampling of recent collaborative devices primarily oriented toward novice interplay. It is our intention to provide a non-technical overview of design issues inherent in configuring multiplayer experiences, particularly for entry-level players.},

abstract = {A common challenge when performing surface-based registration of images is ensuring that the surfaces accurately represent consistent anatomical boundaries. Image segmentation may be difficult in some regions due to either poor contrast, low slice resolution, or tissue ambiguities. To address this, we present a novel non-rigid surface registration method designed to register two partial surfaces, capable of ignoring regions where the anatomical boundary is unclear. Our probabilistic approach incorporates prior geometric information in the form of a statistical shape model (SSM), and physical knowledge in the form of a finite element model (FEM). We validate results in the context of prostate interventions by registering pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to 3D transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). We show that both the geometric and physical priors significantly decrease net target registration error (TRE), leading to TREs of 2.35 $pm$ 0.81 mm and 2.81 $pm$ 0.66 mm when applied to full and partial surfaces, respectively. We investigate robustness in response to errors in segmentation, varying levels of missing data, and adjusting the tunable parameters. Results demonstrate that the proposed surface registration method is an efficient, robust, and effective solution for fusing data from multiple modalities.},

abstract = {In surface-based registration for image-guided interventions, the presence of missing data can be a significant issue. This often arises with real-time imaging modalities such as ultrasound, where poor contrast can make tissue boundaries difficult to distinguish from surrounding tissue. Missing data poses two challenges: ambiguity in establishing correspondences; and extrapolation of the deformation field to those missing regions. To address these, we present a novel non-rigid registration method. For establishing correspondences, we use a probabilistic framework based on a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) that treats one surface as a potentially partial observation. To extrapolate and constrain the deformation field, we incorporate biomechanical prior knowledge in the form of a finite element model (FEM). We validate the algorithm, referred to as GMM-FEM, in the context of prostate interventions. Our method leads to a significant reduction in target registration error (TRE) compared to similar state-of-the-art registration algorithms in the case of missing data up to 30%, with a mean TRE of 2.6 mm. The method also performs well when full segmentations are available, leading to TREs that are comparable to or better than other surface-based techniques. We also analyze robustness of our approach, showing that GMM-FEM is a practical and reliable solution for surface-based registration.},

abstract = {Abstract The traditional hinge axis theory for guiding clinical procedures in dentistry and dental articulators has been challenged by the concept of an instantaneous center of rotation (ICR), which is becoming more prevalent in modern explanations of mandibular movement. The purpose of this study was to analyze traditional hinge axis theory using three-dimensional computer simulations and to compare it with ICR. Three-dimensional computational models that reproduced the traditional pantograph tracing method were created to simulate the opening and closing movements of the jaw. Models of the bones, muscles and ligaments were combined to create a dynamic representation using ArtiSynth, a biomechanical simulation toolkit. The mandibular motion is constrained based on contact between the articular eminence and the mandibular condyle, and is limited by spring-like ligaments, as well as passive properties of the skeletal muscles. To estimate the center of rotation according to the traditional axis theory, markers on the pantograph were traced during mandibular opening and closing movement. The ICR was computed at each time step throughout the simulation. To locate a single hinge axis in simulation, the point about which the mandible seems to rotate during early opening and terminal closing was determined. The estimated center of rotation was inconsistent with the ICR, yet motion was found to be well approximated by a pure rotation. The inconsistency suggests that the use of the ICR position for the clinical dental procedures has its limitations.},

school = {UBC},
abstract = {Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a syndrome in which the human Upper Airway (UA) collapses during sleep leading to frequent sleep disruption and inadequate air supply to the lungs. OSA involves Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) between a complex airflow regime and intricate mechanics of soft and hard tissue, causing large deformation of the complicated UA geometry. Numerical simulations provide a means for understanding this complex system, therefore, we develop a validated FSI simulation, composed of a 1D fluid model coupled with a 3D FEM solid solver (Artisynth), that is applied to a parameterized airway model providing a fast and versatile system for researching FSI in the UA. The 1D fluid model implements the limited pressure recovery model of Cancelli and Pedley (1985) using a dynamic pressure recovery term, area function corrections allowing complete closure and reopening of fluid geometries, and discretization schemes providing robust behavior in highly-uneven geometries. The fluid model is validated against 3D fluid simulations in static geometries and simple dynamic geometries, and proves reliable for predicting bulk flow pressure. Validation of simulation methods in Artisynth is demonstrated by simulating the buckling, complete collapse, and reopening of elastic tubes under static pressure which compare well with experimental results. The FSI simulation is validated against experiments performed for a collapsible channel (a "2D" Starling resistor) designed to have geometry and characteristics similar to the UA. The observed FSI behaviors are described and compared for both experiment and simulation, providing a quantitative validation of the FSI simulation. The simulations and experiments agree quite well, exhibiting the same major FSI behaviors, similar progression from one behavior to another, and similar dynamic range. A parameterized UA model is designed for fast and consistent creation of geometries. Uniform pressure and dynamic flow FSI simulations are performed with this model for numerous parameters associated with OSA. Uniform pressure simulations compare well to clinical data. Dynamic flow results demonstrate airflow limitation and snoring oscillations. The simulations are fast, simulating 1 s of FSI in 30 minutes. This model is a powerful tool for understanding the complex mechanics of OSA.},

Simulations revealed a sphincter-like general operation for the OPI, particularly with regard to the function of the palatoglossus muscle. Furthermore, as has been observed with the lips, the OPI can be controlled by multiple distinct muscular mechanisms, each reliably producing a different-sized opening and robust to activation noise suggestive of modular motor control for speech. As off-midline structures of the OPI are difficult to observe during speech production, biomechanical simulation offers a promising approach to studying these structures.},

abstract = {Finite element (FE) models of muscle are able to represent both complex muscle geometry and internal fibre architecture. However, due to an inability to capture fibres in detail by conventional imaging, most current models assume simple fibre distributions. These are often registered from a minimal set of contrived templates. To improve realism, we propose to use detailed fibre fields, digitized from a cadaver, for defining the internal muscle structure in models. We present a workflow for registering these detailed digitized descriptions to subject-specific muscle geometries, which can then be incorporated into the FE model for use with a transversely isotropic constitutive law. The importance of capturing this detail is emphasized with two examples of muscle groups found in the forearm: the extensor carpi radialis longus and the flexor digitorum superficialis. We show that simplified fibre fields can lead to a 10–20% difference in predicted muscle force and equally significant differences in contracted geometries.},

abstract = {A 1D fluid model is implemented for the purpose of fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations in complex and completely collapsible geometries, particularly targeting the case of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The fluid mechanics are solved separately from any solid mechanics, making possible the use of a highly complex and/or black-box solver for the solid mechanics. The fluid model is temporally discretized with a second-order scheme and spatially discretized with an asymmetrical fourth-order scheme that is robust in highly uneven geometries. A completely collapsing and reopening geometry is handled smoothly using a modified area function. The numerical implementation is tested with two driven-geometry cases: (1) an inviscid analytical solution and (2) a completely closing geometry with viscous flow. Three-dimensional fluid simulations in static geometries are performed to examine the assumptions of the 1D model, and with a well-defined pressure-recovery constant the 1D model agrees well with 3D models. The model is very fast computationally, is robust, and is recommended for OSA simulations where the bulk flow pressure is primarily of interest.},
