      "Nima's research involves adult spinal deformity, defined as abnormal spine
      curvature, which is an increasingly prevalent disorder among the aging population.

      Musculoskeletal modeling is a powerful tool that has been used by biomedical
      researchers to enhance our knowledge of human body kinetics and kinematics.
      Traditional predictor models have primarily only used radiographic parameters
      to assess the risk of PJF, with varying rates of success. Given the biomechanical
      importance of spine curvature and surrounding muscles in spinal deformity, there
      is an opportunity and a need to improve PJF predictability by utilizing musculoskeletal
      modeling.

      Nima's research aims to develop a tool to be used in a clinical setting, by
      surgeons, to modify each patient’s surgical planning based on their individual
      conditions or needs."

      as a minimization problem of various objective functions that describe the shape
      variations in the reconstruction plan. The framework will ultimately be adopted
      as a virtual tool by surgeons during surgery.

      He also uses conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), to create predictive

    project-description:
      We want to find the inner muscle representation of human
      speech, since we don't know exactly how the different organs, or more specifically,
      muscles in the articulatory area, map to acoustic elements. Currently, we are
      using MRI videos and audios from USC-TIMIT dataset as out input, and trying
      to train a neural network to accomplish the task. One of the main challenges
      is to apply the physical constraints onto our neural network model.

    text: "Ph.D. student (2021-present)

      I am a Ph.D. student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at
      The University of British Columbia, advised by Sidney Fels and Victor Zappi.
      My research interests lie in articulatory speech synthesis and neural control
      of speech synthesizers for speech production tasks. Currently, I am modelling
      a physics-based human vocal tract that could help in designing real-time articulatory
      speech synthesis and understanding the human speech production mechanism.

      Outside of research, I love photography."
